The backend parts of this app are located in src/com.amzi.servlet, com.amzi.util and the default package.
They contain the java code necessary to connect to our database. In the default package there is a db.properties
file that provides database info to our servlets.

In the web pages folder is our frontend. What you should mainly use is index.html, the main page, which redirects
you around the app when needed.
